# ttp229-arduino
This is my Ardoaino ttp229 library!

Copy the "TTP229" library folder to your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder.
Restart the IDE (close and open again).

Then in Arduino IDE:
File -> Examples -> TTP229 -> KeyToSerial.
File -> Examples -> TTP229 -> Calculator.

Follow the connection instructions at the beginning of each sample!
In addition I've included a picture that illustrates the connections.


Enjoy :)
